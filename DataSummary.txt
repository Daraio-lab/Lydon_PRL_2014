Here included is the data used for the 


To view the data. Load the data file, and then run the corresponding visualization file using Matlab.

The Band.mat is the data file looking at the frequency response in the near and far force sensors. 
The file plotbanddata.m plots the experimental data along with the theoretical acoustic band edges. 
This corresponds to figure 2 a and b in the paper. 

The Modes_Fine.mat is a matlab data file that tracks the mode profile while compressing the lattice. 
The file plotmode_fine.m plots this data with increaseing precompression.
This data corresponds to figure 2c-e and  Fig 3b in the paper. 

Data_2D.mat is the data file corresponding the the 2D eigenvalue simulation.
buildmovie.m is the file used to visulize this data.
